<p>This project was created using <strong>Java</strong>(Spring Boot, MVC & Security) and <strong>MySQL</strong> & <strong>Hibernate</strong> ORM on the back-end. </p>
<p>The front-end was written in <strong>JavaScript</strong>, using the <strong>React.js</strong> framework.</p>
<p>The Java back-end is basically a (not yet fully compliant) <strong>REST</strong> API which serves content to the React front-end</p>
<p>I chose not to use a server-side template engine such as Thymeleaf as I have more experience with React</p>
<p>The web app was deployed to <strong>Heroku</strong> as two separate projects that communicate with each other securely via HTTPS</p>
<p>This GitHub repository contains the local version of the app</p>
<p>The actual Heroku web app is a bit different(updated links, HTTPS support) & has a different folder layout</p>

# Features
<p><strong>Dynamically</strong> generated pages with products from a database</p>
<p>User <strong>Authentication</strong> & <strong>Registration</strong></p>
<p>MySQL Database with <strong>secured</strong> passwords</p>
<p><strong>Role-based</strong> authentication(<strong>User</strong> & <strong>Admin</strong>, but can easily be extended to any number)</p>
<p>Admin panel for adding/editing products(the entire web app can be controlled through the UI, no need to dive into the code)</p>
<p>All content served over <strong>HTTPS</strong></p>
